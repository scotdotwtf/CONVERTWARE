<span style="color:#98add6">// ABOUT CONVERTWARE //<span> <br /> <br />

<span style="color:#8c9ef7">★ what is convertwere?</span> <br />
-
- convertware is a open source project/script hub made by me (spec) and basically i just got a shit-load of old fd scripts and converted them to fe manually and gave em mizt reanim and then also credited the hell out of the people who made the scripts

<span style="color:#8c9ef7">★ why did you make this?</span> <br />
-
- i just felt i wanted a hub like homebrew/filterware to be a thing again and the best way to do it (in my opinion) was make a hub like homebrew/filterware and add stuff that i knew i would use <br />
<br /> <br />

<span style="color:#98add6">// CLEARING UP STUFF //</span> <br /> <br />

<span style="color:#8c9ef7">★ would/should i be considered a skid for making a hub with no scripts i made?</span> <br />
-
- well i did convert all of them **manually** like i litterally had to go through all 22+ scripts and convert them to fe so i feel that sure, you could call me a skid but a smart one at that ;)

<span style="color:#8c9ef7">★ why did i use mizt reanimation?</span> <br />
-
- so i tried 3 reanimations and out of all of them mizt felt the most understandable while also looking the best and just be exetremely reliable <br />
<br />

<span style="color:#8c9ef7">★ why did i try to credit as much as i did?</span> <br />
-
- i feel that if i'm gonna use someone elses thing i want everyone to know its not mine

<span style="color:#8c9ef7">★ why did you make this open source?</span> <br />
-
- i hope people will learn from my projects and i dont really care about people skidding my converts or stuff <br />
<br /> <br />
